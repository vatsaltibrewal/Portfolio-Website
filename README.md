# Vatsal Tibrewal - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as a Full-Stack and Blockchain Developer. The site is built with a focus on a clean, modern aesthetic, full responsiveness, and easy content management.

**[Live Demo](https://vatsaltibrewal.com/)**

## Features

- **Multi-Page Layout**: Separate, dedicated pages for About Me, Experience, Projects, and Skills.
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Seamless theme switching with a user-friendly toggle.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: A clean three-column layout on desktop that transforms into a mobile-friendly header and bottom navigation on smaller screens.
- **Centralized Data Management**: All personal data (projects, experience, skills) is stored in a structured `/data` directory, making updates simple and quick without touching the UI code.
